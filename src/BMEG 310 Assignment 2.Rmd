# Based on cumulative proportion we get in Q1.1 and plots we get, we can see that the first 6 components (PC1-PC7) has an eigenvalue > 1 and represent 90% of the variance in the data. We can preserve 90% of the variability by 6 dimensionality of the reduced feature space.

# Question 1.5
# I think the first figure is better because the distribution of points in Figure 1 is more dense and there is not much overlap
